# Story 1.3: Pair-Isolated Risk & State Management

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** trader,
**I want** each pair's risk controls, drawdown tracking, and logging to stay isolated,
**so that** an issue on one symbol never disturbs the others.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Equity stop logic tracks peak equity per symbol and closes only that symbol's positions when the configured drawdown threshold is breached.
2. Position or pending counts and state caches are namespaced by symbol and do not leak between engines.
3. Logs and dashboard lines include symbol identifiers and summarise current exposure, drawdown utilisation, and last action.
4. Unit or backtest verification compares single-symbol and multi-symbol runs to confirm parity within an acceptable tolerance.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the configuration and state registry foundation:
- `SymbolConfigEntry` DTO holds per-symbol overrides including risk parameters (lot size, grid params, drawdown threshold)
- `SymbolRuntimeState` DTO tracks live telemetry: `symbol`, `signalState`, `openTrades`, `drawdownPercent`, `lastActionTime`, `correlationBlocked`
- `SymbolStateRegistry` provides in-memory access to configuration and runtime state snapshots, ensuring modules access consistent data
- `CoreOrchestrator` handles initialization, symbol subscription, and event loop coordination
- `StructuredLogger` enforces ASCII-only logging with event codes (max 10 chars, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)

Story 1.2 implemented the symbol engine trade lifecycle:
- `SymbolEngine` class executes fairPrice trade logic independently per symbol: signal evaluation, grid placement, entry/exit
- `TradeProxy` service wraps MT5 trade API calls with normalization, error handling, and logging
- Tick processing is dispatched per symbol via `CoreOrchestrator.DispatchTick(symbol, tick)` to corresponding engine
- Each engine maintains independent indicator handles (EMA buffers) and processes ticks without cross-symbol interference
- Filter enforcement (spread, slippage, trading hours) is applied per symbol before order submission

### Data Models
- **SymbolConfigEntry** stores per-symbol risk parameters including `maxDrawdownPercent` threshold that triggers equity stop [Source: architecture-fullstack/data-models.md#symbolconfigentry]
- **SymbolRuntimeState** maintains live telemetry including `drawdownPercent` (calculated peak-to-current), `openTrades` count, and `lastActionTime` [Source: architecture-fullstack/data-models.md#symbolruntimestate]
- **SymbolRuntimeState** should be extended with `peakEquity` and `currentEquity` fields to track equity stop logic per symbol [Source: architecture-fullstack/data-models.md#symbolruntimestate]
- Engines update `SymbolRuntimeState` after processing ticks and publish to `SymbolStateRegistry` for dashboard and persistence access [Source: architecture-fullstack/data-models.md#symbolruntimestate]

### API Specifications
- **SymbolEngine** exposes `ProcessTick(MqlTick tick)` to handle tick events and should implement `UpdateEquity()` and `CheckEquityStop()` methods for risk tracking [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#symbol-engine]
- **SymbolEngine** exposes `GetRuntimeState()` to publish current state including equity tracking fields [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#symbol-engine]
- **TradeProxy** wraps MT5 trade API calls and should provide `CloseAll(string symbol)` method to close all positions and pending orders for a specific symbol [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#symbol-engine]
- **StructuredLogger** standardizes log entries and should ensure all engine events include symbol identifier in message or metadata [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#logging-and-alert-facade]

### Component Specifications
- **Symbol Engine** class lives in `Experts/fairPriceMP/Engines/SymbolEngine.mqh` and must maintain independent equity tracking per symbol instance [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#symbol-engine]
- Engine must calculate peak equity by comparing current equity to stored peak and updating when current exceeds peak [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#symbol-engine]
- Drawdown percentage = ((peakEquity - currentEquity) / peakEquity) * 100.0 [Source: architecture-fullstack/data-models.md#symbolruntimestate]
- Position and pending order queries must use symbol-specific filters: `PositionSelect(symbol)`, `OrderSelect(symbol)` to prevent count leakage [Source: architecture-fullstack/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
- **Dashboard Renderer** lives in `Experts/fairPriceMP/UI/DashboardRenderer.mqh` and must render per-symbol rows with telemetry fields [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#dashboard-renderer]
- Dashboard should display: symbol name, signal state badge, open trades count, exposure in lots, drawdown %, correlation blocked badge, last action timestamp [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#dashboard-renderer]
- Dashboard summary strip should aggregate: total exposure across all symbols, maximum drawdown among all symbols, count of correlation-blocked symbols [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#dashboard-renderer]

- **Tests**: Backend unit tests in `Scripts/Test_SymbolEngine_Risk.mq5` (new) [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]

### Testing Requirements
- **Backend unit tests** must verify equity tracking calculations, equity stop triggers, and isolation between symbol engines [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- Test equity tracking: simulate tick sequence with price movements, verify peak equity updates and drawdown calculations [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- Test equity stop: configure low drawdown threshold, simulate losing trades, verify only affected symbol's positions close [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- Test isolation: create multiple engine instances with different symbols, verify state, counts, and indicator handles do not leak [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- Test logging: verify all engine-related logs include symbol identifier in expected format [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- **E2E tests** via MT5 strategy tester: run same symbol in single-symbol and multi-symbol EA configurations, export logs, diff equity events [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]
- Log diff scripts must confirm parity for equity tracking, drawdown calculations, and equity stop triggers within tolerance [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]
- Acceptable tolerance: equity values within 0.01%, event timestamps within 1 tick difference [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]

### Technical Constraints
- **ASCII-only strings**: All log messages, dashboard labels, and filenames must be ASCII; reject or sanitize Unicode [Source: architecture-fullstack/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
- **MT5 build >= 3900**: Required for compatibility; single-process execution constraint applies [Source: architecture-fullstack/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Symbol-specific queries**: Use `PositionSelect(symbol)` and `OrderSelect(symbol)` to filter positions/orders by symbol [Source: architecture-fullstack/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
- **Error handling**: Capture `GetLastError()` and trade result codes, log via `StructuredLogger` on failure [Source: architecture-fullstack/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
- **Tick processing performance**: Target under 10 ms per tick; cache indicator buffers and avoid redundant calculations [Source: architecture-fullstack/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization]
- **Equity calculation**: Use `AccountInfoDouble(ACCOUNT_EQUITY)` to get current equity; filter by symbol's magic number for per-symbol equity [Source: architecture-fullstack/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
- **Dashboard rendering**: Limit chart objects to fewer than 400; reuse object IDs to avoid flicker; throttle redraw to 1 Hz [Source: architecture-fullstack/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization]
- **Alerts**: Use MT5 alert facade for critical events (equity stop) with ASCII-only text [Source: architecture-fullstack/components.md#logging-and-alert-facade]

### Testing
- **Backend unit tests**: Equity tracking calculations, equity stop triggers, isolation between engines, logging format validation [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- **E2E strategy tester**: Back-to-back single-symbol vs multi-symbol runs with log diff verification for equity events [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]
- **Test location**: `Scripts/Test_SymbolEngine_Risk.mq5` for unit tests [Source: architecture-fullstack/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
