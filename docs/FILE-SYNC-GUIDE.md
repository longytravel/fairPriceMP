‚úÖ **Syncs all folders** - Experts, Include, Scripts, Files, Indicators, Libraries
‚úÖ **One-way sync** - Dev folder ‚Üí MT5 (you control the source)
‚úÖ **Auto-backup** - Creates timestamped backups before overwriting
‚úÖ **Desktop notifications** - Popup alerts when files sync
‚úÖ **Smart retry logic** - Handles file locks and MetaEditor conflicts
‚úÖ **Compile reminders** - Visual reminder to hit F7 for .mq5/.mqh files
‚úÖ **Initial bulk sync** - Syncs all existing files on startup

## How It Works

### File Flow
```
Your Dev Folder (fairPriceMP/)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Experts/fairPriceMP/SymbolEngine.mqh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Include/fairPriceMP/DTO/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scripts/Test_*.mq5
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Files/config.csv
            ‚îÇ
            ‚îÇ (Auto-sync on save)
            ‚Üì
MT5 Terminal (MQL5/)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Experts/fairPriceMP/SymbolEngine.mqh  ‚úÖ Synced
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Include/fairPriceMP/DTO/              ‚úÖ Synced
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scripts/Test_*.mq5                    ‚úÖ Synced
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Files/config.csv                      ‚úÖ Synced
```

### Backup System
Before overwriting any file in MT5, a backup is created:
```
Backups/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SymbolEngine_20251003_193045.mqh
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TradeProxy_20251003_193112.mqh
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config_20251003_193210.csv
```

Backups are timestamped: `filename_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext`

## Monitored Folders

The sync watches these folders in your dev directory:

| Folder | Purpose | Synced |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `Experts/` | Expert Advisors (.mq5) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `Include/` | Include files (.mqh) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `Scripts/` | Test scripts | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `Files/` | Config/data files | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `Indicators/` | Custom indicators | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `Libraries/` | MQL5 libraries | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Everything inside these folders syncs automatically!**

---

## Monitored File Types

The enhanced sync monitors **ALL file types** by default:

### Source Code
- `.mq5` - MQL5 Expert Advisors
- `.mqh` - MQL5 Include files
- `.ex5` - Compiled executables

### Data & Config
- `.csv` - CSV data files
- `.json` - JSON configuration
- `.txt` - Text files
- `.log` - Log files

### And More
- **Literally any file type** - The sync uses `*.*` to catch everything

---

## Important Workflow

### For .mq5 and .mqh Files (Source Code)

1. **Edit file** in your dev folder (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
2. **Save file** (Ctrl+S)
3. **See sync notification** ‚Üí "Synced: Experts/fairPriceMP/SymbolEngine.mqh"
4. **Open MetaEditor** in MT5
5. **Navigate to the file**
6. **Press F7** to compile

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The sync does NOT auto-compile. You must manually press F7 in MetaEditor.

### For Data Files (.csv, .json, .txt)

1. **Edit file** in your dev folder
2. **Save file**
3. **Done!** File is instantly available in MT5

No compilation needed for data files.

## Configuration

### Config File Location
`sync-config.json`

### Customizable Settings

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "syncMode": "one-way",           // one-way or bidirectional
    "autoCompile": false,            // Auto F7 (requires MetaEditor CLI)
    "autoCommit": false,             // Auto git commit
    "createBackups": true            // Backup before overwrite
  },
  "folders": [
    "Experts",
    "Include",
    "Scripts",
    "Files",
    "Indicators",
    "Libraries"
  ],
  "notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "showFileType": true,
    "compileReminder": true
  }
}
```

### How to Modify

1. Open `sync-config.json` in any text editor
2. Change values as needed
3. Restart the sync script for changes to take effect

**Current Setup (Your Preferences):**
- ‚úÖ One-way sync (Dev ‚Üí MT5)
- ‚úÖ Manual compile (you press F7)
- ‚úÖ Manual git commits
- ‚úÖ All file types monitored
- ‚úÖ All folders synced

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: File not syncing

**Cause**: File is outside monitored folders
**Fix**: Ensure file is in Experts/, Include/, Scripts/, Files/, Indicators/, or Libraries/

**Cause**: Sync script not running
**Fix**: Run `Start_Enhanced_Sync.bat`

### Issue: File is locked error

**Cause**: MetaEditor has the file open
**Fix**: Close file in MetaEditor, save again in dev folder. Sync will retry automatically.

### Issue: Compile fails after sync

**Cause**: Include paths changed
**Fix**: Check #include statements in your .mq5 files

### Issue: No desktop notification

**Cause**: Windows notification settings
**Fix**: Check Windows notification permissions for PowerShell

### Issue: Want to stop sync temporarily

**Fix**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell window

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO
- Keep sync running while developing
- Save files in dev folder (fairPriceMP/)
- Press F7 in MetaEditor after syncing source files
- Check console for sync confirmations
- Use backups if you need to restore

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Don't edit files directly in MT5 terminal folders
- Don't manually copy files (let sync handle it)
- Don't close MetaEditor while files are compiling
- Don't delete backup folder (it's your safety net)

---

## Advanced Usage

### Run Sync on Windows Startup

1. Press `Win+R`
2. Type: `shell:startup`
3. Create shortcut to `Start_Enhanced_Sync.bat`
4. Sync starts automatically when you login

### View Sync Logs

All sync activity appears in the PowerShell console in real-time.

### Restore from Backup

1. Go to `Backups/` folder
2. Find the backup file with timestamp
3. Copy to MT5 terminal folder
4. Recompile if needed
