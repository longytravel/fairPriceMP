- Architecture readiness: Ready. All core constraints, risks, and priorities are captured.

**Category Outcomes**
- Problem Definition & Context - PASS: Problem, persona, success metrics, and differentiation are clearly articulated.
- MVP Scope Definition - PASS: In-scope, out-of-scope, delivery priorities, and validation plan provide actionable boundaries.
- User Experience Requirements - PASS: Journeys, dashboard interaction, error handling, and accessibility expectations are covered.
- Functional Requirements - PASS: Requirements are testable, prioritised, and tied to the epics; logging and persistence obligations are explicit.
- Non-Functional Requirements - PASS: Performance, determinism, restart behaviour, and logging constraints are defined.
- Epic & Story Structure - PASS: Epics are sequential, dependencies are listed, and stories remain developer-sized with acceptance criteria.
- Technical Guidance - PASS: Decisions, trade-offs, and known risks are captured for the architect.
- Cross-Functional Requirements - PASS: Data, integration, operational, security, and monitoring needs are documented.
- Clarity & Communication - PASS: Document structure, stakeholder notes, and change log readiness support ongoing collaboration.

**Follow-Up Suggestions (No Blockers)**
- Prepare the upcoming troubleshooting appendix and expand the change log as iterations occur.
- Define log file naming conventions and retention scripts during implementation to align with the operational plan.
- Coordinate with UX and architecture to keep dashboard visuals and module interfaces aligned with this scope.
