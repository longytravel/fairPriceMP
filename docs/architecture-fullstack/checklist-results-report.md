# Checklist Results Report
### architect-checklist (2025-10-02)
- Execution mode: Comprehensive (all-at-once)
- Overall assessment: **Ready with minor follow-ups**

| Section | Pass Rate | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1. Requirements Alignment | 100% | PASS | Architecture maps cleanly to PRD epics, including correlation guardrails, tester support, and dashboard expectations. |
| 2. Architecture Fundamentals | 100% | PASS | Component responsibilities, diagrams, and data flows are explicitly documented for the MT5 modular monolith. |
| 3. Modularity & Maintainability | 100% | PASS | Shared DTOs, wrapper layers, and clear module folders keep concerns separated and change-friendly. |
| 4. Data Management & Persistence | 100% | PASS | Snapshot schema, rotation guidance, and ASCII-safety requirements cover persistence and data hygiene. |
| 5. Security, Reliability & Monitoring | 90% | PASS | Operational logging and alerting are defined; document clarifies security posture, though VPS hardening tasks should be tracked separately. |
| 6. Scalability & Performance | 90% | PASS | Tick latency targets and scheduling strategy are outlined; profiling plan for 28-symbol load should be confirmed during implementation. |
| 7. Implementation Readiness & Tooling | 100% | PASS | Coding standards, testing stack, workflow, and deployment scripts provide clear developer guidance. |
| 8. Dependency & Integration Management | 80% | PARTIAL | External dependency list is short but fallback/update strategy for MT5 releases and Windows patches needs explicit ownership. |
| 9. AI Agent Implementation Suitability | 100% | PASS | Uniform naming, DTO reuse, and command queue patterns tailor the codebase for AI agent execution. |
| 10. Accessibility (Frontend Only) | N/A | N/A | MT5 on-chart UI does not support web accessibility tooling; documented as out-of-scope for this environment. |

**Key Risks & Follow-ups**
1. Correlation workload under 28-symbol stress needs profiling to confirm CPU headroom on target VPS class.
2. Single-terminal dependency: document contingency for terminal restarts/updates (schedule maintenance windows & backup plan).
3. MT5/Windows update policy unspecifiedï¿½assign owner for patch cadence and rollback steps.
4. Snapshot rotation threshold (50 MB) may still grow quickly during heavy tester usage; define archival or purge automation.
5. Alert fatigue risk if structured logger fires too many CRITICAL events; recommend severity tuning during beta.

**Recommendations**
- **Must address:** Formalize MT5/Windows update & rollback SOP; add to deployment workflow.
- **Should address:** Add profiling task for correlation scheduler under max pair load; document expected CPU/memory budget.
- **Nice to have:** Provide sample PowerShell script for snapshot archival and log pruning to keep Files directory tidy.

The architecture is ready for development handoff once the dependency management notes above are captured in the runbook.
