# Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for fairPriceMP, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project
The multi-symbol EA builds on the existing single-symbol `fairPrice.mq5` codebase already present in this repository. We will refactor that proven trading logic into modular per-symbol engines, layer in correlation control, and add dashboard and persistence layers; no external starter templates are being imported. Key constraints: retain compatibility with MT5 strategy tester workflows, preserve the core grid/MA trade behaviour, and respect the existing user configuration surface while extending it for multi-symbol control.
