| Category                | Technology / Toolset                                      | Version           | Purpose                                                | Rationale                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Language       | MQL5 (strict)                                             | MT5 build >= 3900 | Render dashboard UI layers and handle EA events        | Native language for MT5 ensures deterministic execution and compatibility with broker-supported builds.    |
| Frontend Framework      | MT5 chart objects and events                              | Built-in          | Drive on-chart dashboard layout and interactions       | MT5 primitives deliver low-latency rendering without external dependencies and keep artefacts inside Experts. |
| UI Component Library    | Custom `DashboardRenderer` module (`Experts/fairPriceMP`) | v1                | Encapsulate table or grid drawing, badges, and tooltips| Purpose-built module keeps UI logic reusable and stored alongside EA assets for VPS sync.                   |
| State Management        | `SymbolStateRegistry` (in-memory plus global variables)   | v1                | Maintain per-symbol telemetry and config state         | Tailored registry balances tick-level latency with restart persistence needs.                              |
| Backend Language        | MQL5 (strict)                                             | MT5 build >= 3900 | Core trading logic, correlation engine, persistence    | Single-language stack simplifies modularization inside MT5 single-process constraint.                       |
| Backend Framework       | Native MQL5 services (`CTrade`, `OnTimer`, modules)       | Built-in          | Trade execution, scheduling, event handling            | Leveraging proven MT5 abstractions avoids reinventing infrastructure and keeps the EA portable.            |
| Data Storage            | MT5 `Files` directory (CSV or JSON snapshots)             | MT5 file API      | Persist run state, metrics, and backtest outputs       | Aligns with requirement to mirror MT5 folder names and ensures VPS sync scripts remain trivial.             |
| Caching Layer           | In-memory arrays plus MT5 global variables                | Built-in          | Cache indicator buffers, correlation windows, configs  | Provides fast access while allowing crash-safe recovery via global variables.                               |
| Authentication & Authz  | MT5 terminal account credentials                          | Broker managed    | Secure trading session with broker                     | No additional auth layer; relies on broker-secured login while keeping credentials out of the repository.  |
| API Approach            | In-process module interfaces                              | N/A               | Module-to-module contracts via DTOs and dispatcher     | Eliminates network overhead, matching single-terminal deployment and tester determinism requirements.       |
| Testing & QA Tools      | MT5 strategy tester (multi-currency), log diff scripts    | MT5 built-in plus PS | Regression, optimisation, deterministic log validation | Supports PRD requirement for multi-symbol backtests and repeatable metrics exports.                         |
| Build & Deployment      | MetaEditor or `mql.exe` compiler, PowerShell sync scripts | MT5 toolchain     | Compile EA, push artefacts into `MQL5\\Experts` and `Include` | Maintains folder parity with MT5 on the VPS and enables scripted deployments and backups.                   |
| Monitoring & Logging    | Terminal journal, custom structured log module            | MT5 plus custom   | Operational telemetry, alert routing, file exports     | Unified logging keeps audit trail accessible on VPS and via synced Files outputs for post-run analysis.     |
